== About This Directory

This directory contains initial code for {P523: Programming Language Implementation}[http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~achauhan/Teaching/P523/2012-Spring/].  Feel free to edit this file (README) to document your code.  README is used by <tt>rdoc</tt> to generate HTML documentation and can use HTML markup.  The supplied Rakefile has a rule for generating the documentation rooted at README.
  $ rake rdoc


== Getting Started

1. Make sure you are able to run GNU <tt>flex</tt>.  It is available on all CS machines and should already be in your PATH.

2. Run <tt>rake</tt> in the top-level directory.  Make sure you have the <tt>rake</tt> and <tt>racc</tt> gems installed.
  $ gem install rake
  $ gem install racc
  $ rake

This will install <tt>gem</tt> and <tt>racc</tt>, respectively, in the <tt>.gem</tt> directory in your home and then run <tt>rake</tt>.  You may have to add appropriate directories under <tt>.gem</tt> to your <tt>PATH</tt>.

Optionally:

1. Run <tt>rake rdoc</tt> in the top-level directory to generate HTML documentation inside the <tt>doc</tt> directory.  This will also automatically document all your code.

2. Run <tt>rake clean</tt> or <tt>rake clobber</tt> to clean up the directories.


== Running Ruby Code

Include the following magic lines of code at the top of your Ruby file, assuming you are writing it in your trunk directory.
  $:.unshift "#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}", "#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/../RubyWrite/"

This ensures that Ruby finds all the files to load.  Alternatively you may define the environment variable <tt>RUBYLIB</tt> to point to the two directories.  For example, if <tt>path/to/root</tt> denotes the full path to the root directory of your code, then in <tt>bash</tt>:
  $ export RUBYLIB=/path/to/root:path/to/root/RubyWrite

The code is run by passing it to Ruby interpreter.
  $ ruby parsetest.rb < test/parsing/example0.c
